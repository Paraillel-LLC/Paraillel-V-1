Lesson Title: "Fun with Addition and Subtraction"

Objective: Students will be able to solve addition and subtraction word problems within 20 using objects, drawings, and equations. They will also be able to ask and answer questions about key details in a text related to addition and subtraction.

Materials:
1. Counting objects (beans, buttons, blocks, etc.)
2. Colored pencils, markers, or crayons
3. Whiteboard and markers
4. Addition and subtraction word problems worksheets 
5. "The Berenstain Bears: The Missing Dinosaur Bone" by Stan and Jan Berenstain (optional)

Lesson Introduction (15 minutes):
1. Gather the students on the carpet and introduce the lesson topic: addition and subtraction. Ask the students if they know what addition and subtraction mean. Allow for a brief discussion and clarify any misconceptions.
2. Show the students the counting objects and explain how they will be using them to solve problems in the lesson.
3. Introduce the book "The Berenstain Bears: The Missing Dinosaur Bone", if using. Ask the students to pay attention to how the bears use addition and subtraction to find the missing bone.

Direct Instruction (30 minutes):
1. Write the numbers 1-10 on the whiteboard. Ask the students to count along as you point to each number.
2. Using the counting objects, model how to add and subtract with numbers 1-10. Allow for a few student volunteers to participate.
3. Show students how to represent addition and subtraction problems using drawings and equations on the whiteboard.
4. Distribute the addition and subtraction word problems worksheets and explain the instructions. Have students complete the worksheets independently or with a partner.
5. As students are working, circulate around the room and provide assistance as needed.

Guided Practice (30 minutes):
1. Choose 2-3 word problems from the worksheet and solve them on the whiteboard, inviting students to participate and explain their thinking.
2. Have students work in pairs to create their own addition and subtraction word problems using the counting objects and write them on the whiteboard for the class to solve.
3. Allow for students to ask and answer questions about the word problems.

Independent Practice (30 minutes):
1. After discussing solutions to the word problems, have students complete the rest of the worksheet independently.
2. During this time, provide one-on-one assistance to students who may be struggling.
3. Once students have finished, allow for a few volunteers to share their word problems and solutions with the class.

Closure (15 minutes):
1. Gather the students back on the carpet and review the concepts of addition and subtraction.
2. Ask students to share what they learned in the lesson and give examples of how they can use addition and subtraction in their everyday lives.
3. Distribute a short exit slip for students to solve one addition and one subtraction word problem.
4. Collect the exit slips and use them to assess students' understanding of the lesson.

Extension (Optional):
1. Have students create their own addition and subtraction stories using the counting objects and present them to the class.
2. Create a "math center" for students to practice addition and subtraction with various manipulatives such as dice, playing cards, or number flashcards.
3. Use the book "The Berenstain Bears: The Missing Dinosaur Bone" as a read aloud and have students identify and solve addition and subtraction problems in the story.

Assessment:
1. The completed addition and subtraction word problem worksheets.
2. Participation and understanding during guided practice and independent practice.
3. Exit slip results.

Reflection:
1. Were all students able to actively participate and understand the lesson?
2. What adjustments, if any, could be made to improve the lesson?
3. How can this lesson be differentiated for students with varying levels of understanding and ability?
